<h5>History</h5>
<p>One of the earliest civilizations, the Indus Valley civilization flourished on the Indian subcontinent from c. 2600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to c. 2000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> It is generally accepted that the Aryans entered India c. 1500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> from the northwest, finding a land that was already home to an advanced civilization. They introduced Sanskrit and the Vedic religion, a forerunner of Hinduism. Buddhism was founded in the 6th century <span class="small">B.C.</span> and was spread throughout northern India, most notably by one of the great ancient kings of the Mauryan dynasty, Asoka <span class="small">B.C.</span>), who also unified most of the Indian subcontinent for the first time.</p>
